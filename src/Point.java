// If you want to access these variables you cannot access them directly,
// you can just use the provided setter and getter methods to read and write their values.
// The variables which you havenâ€™t provided these methods will be completely hidden from the outside classes.

// By making the variable a private data member, you can more easily ensure that the value is never negative.
// On the other hand, if the variable is public, another class could change it to a negative value which can cause other parts
// of the code to crash.
